11 sampling variability
    # would other samples of the same size from this population have the same sample mean?
    # would other samples of the same size from this population have the same sample median?
    # would other samples of the same size from this population have the same sample spread?
    # if you increase the sample size, would the typical spread increase or decrease?
    # if you decrease the sample size, would the typical spread increase or decrease?

p-values
Easiest question set:
- generate 5 values, ask if they're <0.05?
Easy question set:
- generate 5 values, ask if you should reject the null hypothesis or not?
Medium question set:
- generate 5 values, tell them whether this means you reject H0 or not, and then ask them to choose between 2 interpretations
[Then reapply this method to other types of data or types of test, and also
build up to having 5 different interpretations, 1 of them false]
- Hard question set:
Give p-value, and ask sequence of questions,
  * is p<0.05?
  * would you reject H0?
  * how would you interpret this result?
