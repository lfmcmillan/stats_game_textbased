Next steps
=========

Priorities:
- Fix weather level for case when two different years have same max/min value
- Add recommendation question at the end of each level
- Refactor to separate showing questions from generating questions

Build more levels:
- Implement estimate/parameter question level 5
- Implement varied plots levels 6-9
- Make a large number of additional plots/estimate/parameter levels

Add topics:
- Build probability levels

Build different difficulty levels
- Implement easy/medium/hard versions of each level, using same context [not for first 10 levels?]
{However, note that this pre-supposes that we know what would be easy or hard,
which is a different mentality compared with tracking which types of levels the
user finds easy or hard and thus picking from the topics they find easy or hard.}

Add features:
- Add option to show correct answer immediately or at the end of the level
- Add function that monitors the proportion of correct answers from the different
  levels and assigns difficulty to the different types of levels accordingly

Later additions:
- Option to select whether they're confident or not about the answer
