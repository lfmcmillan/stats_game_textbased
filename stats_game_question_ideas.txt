Survival:
- which crop rots more quickly in storage?

- what actual proportion of the stored food has gone off, based on a small sample? (estimates and confidence intervals)

- which stream has the most samples with amount of contamination below threshold X?

- which part of the island has the most bore sites with water concentration of X below threshold Y?

- does the island have more sunny days or rainy days per year?
--> what kind of shelter to build?

- which material is more effective for keeping out [rain/sun]?

- which material is quicker to build with?

- which material lasts longer in construction?

Psychology:
- are the surviving crew or passengers more traumatised?

- compare solo travellers with travellers in groups

- compare travellers on outbound or return journeys

- compare old or young travellers

- compare travellers with or without existing health conditions

- compare able-bodied or disabled travellers

- compare travellers with or without university education

- assess survivors staying in existing buildings or in constructed shelters

- assess survivors working in one or other part of the island

- assess giving them a random extra ration of X or not

- has average strength of survivors changed over time? (paired t-test)

Biology:
- which crop contains more protein/vitamin A/vitamin C/fibre/etc.?

- which crop grows better in this season i.e. more of the seedlings germinate?

- does this crop grow better with lots of water or not much water?

- does this crop grow better with or without fertiliser?

- does this crop grow better in site A or site B?

- which crop growing site has at least X mm rainfall per day?

- which crop growing site has higher average rainfall per day?

Commerce:
*** Questions about barter and trade amongst the survivors?? ***







Master list of ideas, unfiltered by feasibility:
- more rainy or more sunny? --> what kind of shelter to build
- what resources are available?
