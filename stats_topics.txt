- basic statistics (mean, median, min, max)
[plots and summary stats]

- interpreting plots
[bar charts, complex bar charts, box plots, scatter plots, line plots]

- estimates vs. parameters
[definition of symbols, and then what's value of each object for this data?]

- experiment vs. observational study

- probability questions
  * independence
  * mutual exclusion
  * conditionality

- normal and binomial distributions {no Poisson}

- p-values

- contingency tables

- t-tests
[means, difference of means] {proportions NOT TAUGHT but mentioned}

- type I and type II errors

- sign tests
(and how binomial distribution relates to sign test)

- ANOVA

- confidence intervals
[means] {proportions?}

- chi-squared tests

- linear regression
  * assumptions
  * equations/predictions/residuals
  * confidence intervals interpret
  * p-value interpret

- bootstrapping vs. normality-based CIs

- permutation tests vs. normality-based hypothesis tests


Types of questions to add to Shiny app version:
* drag-and-drop wording of conclusions (i.e. drag phrases into sentence)
* distribution diagram with slider that is either tied to the p-value area or to the test statistic value, and the user has to drag the slider to give the approx p-value area or approx test statistic for this numerical result
